# Adult_Census_Income_Prediction
## Ineuron Internship

The Adult Census Income Prediction project aims to predict whether an individual's income is above or below $50,000. It offers a user-friendly web interface hosted on Render, where users can input their information and get income predictions. This project combines machine learning and web development to provide an easy way to estimate income levels, whether you're online or using it on your own device.

# Approach

The goal is to classify the data and predict whether the income is >= 50K or < 50K

# Webpage

When you visit the website, you will be able to see a form that accepts the data from the user. There the user has to enter the data and press the predict button. Then the result is displayed on the next result page.
